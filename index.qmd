:::{#main}

Salut! Je m'appelle Suchit!  I am a CS engineering sophomore at Ramaiah Institute of Technology at the *Silicon Valley* of India, Bangalore.

I have a strong interest in pursuing a research career in the field of Deep Learning and love the notion of humans working alongside AI. I wish to create AI systems to enhance just about any aspect of the human life.

Bachelors in Information Science and Engineering | Dec 2022 - Present (expected: 2026)

## Experience

#### **GenAI Intern**
##### **[NextWealth](https://www.nextwealth.com/)** | Sep 2024 - Nov 2024

• Leveraged RAG to extract fields of interest from contract documents achieving 90%+ accuracy.

• Utilized LLM-Agents to create multi-turn conversation dataset between E-Commerce customers and support agents with 15,000+ multi-turn conversations.

• Created a detailed analysis of distributions of 8+ dataset augmentation techniques used like tone augmentations, language style augmentations and more.

## More about me

I'm of the tinkering and learning species and my current interests include Machine Learning, reading anything that seems interesting to me (including but not limited to psychology and self-help books, fiction, and half-assing CS books), learning French and playing the Guitar! I am currently taking the fastai course where I am enjoying the top-down learning and iterative approach by the course.

I blog about what I think is interesting, worth remembering and putting it out there for primarily myself in the hope that it's also useful for others. Feel free to DM or raise a PR in case for any edits/suggestions/additions to one of my posts or if you just want to say HI or talk about anything else (or even offer me an internship ;) )!
